## Tips
- If you're sharing just one file, you can use the shortcut name `file` to access itï¼š
    ```bash
    http://{host}:{port}/file
    ```
    To save with the original filename with `wget`:
    ```bash
    wget --content-disposition http://{host}:{port}/file
    ```
    Or with `curl`:
    ```bash
    curl -OJ http://{host}:{port}/file
    ```
- To get an archive of a folder, you can add the `.tar.zst` extension to the url:
    ```bash
    http://{host}:{port}/any/folder.tar.zst
    ```
- If you want to upload files to the sharing server with `curl`, you can use:
    ```bash
    curl -F file=@/path/to/file http://{host}:{port}
    # create new folders at the same time
    curl -F file=@/path/to/file http://{host}:{port}/custom/path
    ```
    Or:
    ```bash
    curl -T /path/to/file http://{host}:{port}
    # create new folders at the same time
    curl -T /path/to/file http://{host}:{port}/custom/path/
    # with a different filename
    curl -T /path/to/file http://{host}:{port}/custom/path/custom-filename
    ```
